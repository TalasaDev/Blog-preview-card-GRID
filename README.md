## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid Layout
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I starting working with grid layout to get familiarized with. During the challenge, I stumped with a few main issues:

- How to use grid and realizing everything I learned was an introductory overview about the layout.
- How to fit a div content. (again)
- Why everything got stuck to the left? (again margins).
- How to change the size of an image element in CSS. The issue is that scaling the image leaves an unwanted space between div and image, making it impossible to align it correctly with other elements. It needs to be shrink the Div size and style the image differently.

### Continued development

This challenge tough me about patience, developing fully understanding of the learning curve. I will keep working grid layout through exercises until better understanding and mastery. Bootstrap framework and SASS will be the next technologies to start working with.


### Useful resources
